| Attack Type                   | Defense Provided                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Sybil attack**              | RSA authentication prevents fake identities.    |
| **Spoofing**                  | Public-key verification ensures authenticity.   |
| **Data injection**            | ML detects abnormal patterns.                   |
| **Replay attack**             | Time-based signatures + block timestamps.       |
| **Tampering/data corruption** | Blockchain immutability protects integrity.     |
| **DDoS on central node**      | Federated model avoids single point of failure. |

| Challenge             | Mitigation Strategy                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heavy ML/crypto loads | Use **lightweight ML models**, e.g. decision trees, and **elliptic curve crypto** instead of RSA. |
| High power usage      | Implement **sleep cycles**, **edge aggregation**, and **energy-aware scheduling**.                |
| Network congestion    | Use **event-driven** transmission rather than continuous streaming.                               |
| Blockchain overhead   | Use **off-chain storage** for bulk data, keep only hashes on chain.                               |
| Implementation cost   | Prototype in **simulated environments** (like your project) before hardware deployment.           |
